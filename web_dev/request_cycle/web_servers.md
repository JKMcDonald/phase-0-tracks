Linux has a Philosophy:
-------------------------
There are nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy.

Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter

A virtual private server is a computer that has all the capabilities of a regular computer without the screen and mouse. It is used to store memory that can be accessed and updated/deleted at anytime and the VPS can be deleted or added at any time so the risk of what is done on a VPS is very low. The benefits are they are easy to make, can store as much as you want, and are like adding a computer to your current one that you control from your computer.

It is dangerous to allow programs to run on your ROOT user on a Linux system because you don't want a small bug in an irrelevant game to crash your whole system and that's what running it from your ROOT user allows to happen. It removes the security and firewall protecting your ROOT files from being tampered with and opens your system up to vulnerabilities on a mass scale.
