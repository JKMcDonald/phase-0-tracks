How to work an elevator:

the pad with the numbers is on the wall where the elevator opens. when you originally walk into the elevator scan left and right for that pad.
The robot will start by asking which floor to press:
wait for a response - if none after 5 seconds ask again
once given the number press the corressponding button on the wall by scanning from top to bottom the available buttons/floors and pushing the right one.  wait for the door to close and the elevator to begin to move. upon arriving at your floor the door will open, walk out.

everyday algorithms I do without noticing:

Brushing my teeth:
Pick up the toothbrush
apply toothpaste
put in your mouth and begin by scrubbing the front teeth making your way back and around until every tooth has been scrubbed from every angle
rinse with water and spit out remainder into sink 
brush your tongue and spit out remainder into sink
rinse and dry face on a towel. 
end
