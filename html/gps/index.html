The purpose of HTML5 semantics tags are to help clarify and section off parts of code so that you can organize for the disabled and anyone needing further clarification and structure. Thre one I find most useful is the <footer> because I like to create links to other pages at the bottom and achknowledge people who contributed. 

The order that the browser displays elements on the page is on a first come first serve basis

I learned you can create snippets to make your life easier when loading layouts. I think I may create more snippets at a later date when I see the opportunity and it shows more benefits.

The concept that was most difficult for me was learning about the extra html5 tags and what they are used for. Continuing to talk it out and come to a solution while researching will yield the best understanding. Also asking for guidance.
